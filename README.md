URL Redirects â€” Migration to Shopify

This repository consolidates sitemaps from the old site and the new Shopify store, plus the CSVs used to create 301 redirects in Shopify.

It includes:

Extracted URLs from sitemaps

Redirect tables (products, blog posts, and other URLs)

Diagnostics (to understand how each redirect was matched)

Helper scripts/notebooks (optional)

All CSVs are in Shopify import format: Redirect from, Redirect to (no headers beyond these two columns).
